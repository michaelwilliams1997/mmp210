             <p>Side effects of opioids may include itchiness, sedation, nausea, respiratory depression, constipation, and euphoria. Tolerance and dependence will develop with continuous use, requiring increasing doses and leading to a withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation. The euphoria attracts recreational use, and frequent, escalating recreational use of opioids typically results in addiction. An overdose or concurrent use with other depressant drugs commonly results in death from respiratory depression.</p>
             <p>An Opioids act by binding to opioid receptors, which are found principally in the central and peripheral nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. These receptors mediate both the psychoactive and the somatic effects of opioids. Opioid drugs include partial agonists, like the anti-diarrhea drug loperamide and antagonists like naloxegol for opioid-induced constipation, which do not cross the blood-brain barrier, but can displace other opioids from binding in those receptors.</p>
             <p>Because of opioid drugs' reputation for addiction and fatal overdose, most are controlled substances. In 2013, between 28 and 38 million people used opioids illicitly (0.6% to 0.8% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). In 2011, an estimated 4 million people in the United States used opioids recreationally or were dependent on them. As of 2015, increased rates of recreational use and addiction are attributed to over-prescription of opioid medications and inexpensive illicit heroin.] Conversely, fears about over-prescribing, exaggerated side effects and addiction from opioids are similarly blamed for under-treatment of pain.</p>

             <p> Science is revealing that the cannabinoid and opioid systems can work synergistically to achieve greater pain relief. This interaction becomes clear when you consume super low-doses of THC or opioids; on their own, these low doses do not relieve pain, but in combination, they do.
              For instance, a recent double-blinded, placebo-controlled study (the gold-standard in clinical research) investigated the effects of low-dose cannabis (5.6% THC) and the opioid drug, oxycodone (2.5 mg) on pain thresholds in human subjects. Neither THC nor oxycodone independently affected pain, but when used in  combination, participants were able to withstand higher levels of painful stimuli consistent with substantial pain reductions.</p>
              <p>To achieve these pain-relieving effects, could THC’s primary target, cannabinoid type I (CB1) receptors, and opioid receptors be working together? There’s evidence that they do.
              Take mice that have been genetically engineered to not express CB1 receptors (that’s right, you can create mice without CB1 receptors!). These mice enjoy nicotine, amphetamines, cocaine, and they’ll eagerly press a lever to self-administer these drugs. But they won’t do it for the opioid drug, heroin. Normal mice do, but not the mice without CB1 receptors. This tells us that CB1 receptors are important in the euphoric effects of heroin. Extending these findings to pain, blocking the activity of CB1 receptors weakens morphine’s ability to reduce pain.</p>

            <p>Prescription opioid abuse represents a large component of the opioid drug crisis in the United States. The rate of fatal overdoses due to oral formulations of natural and semisynthetic opioids (eg, oxycodone, hydrocodone) has risen steadily since 2000, and in 2015 was similar to that of heroin [1].
Many individuals who abuse opioids progress from an initially legitimate, legal use of oral opioids, to misuse, tolerance, abuse, and possible addiction. Abusers may swallow many pills at once, but may also chew the tablets or crush them to facilitate smoking, inhalation, or intravenous (IV) injection, all of which increase the risks of overdose and addiction. Abuse deterrent formulations (ADFs) of opioids are designed to prevent these routes of administration, while retaining efficacy with oral administration for legitimate pain relief. Prescription of ADF opioids is controversial because of unanswered questions about their ability to reduce overall opioid abuse, and their higher cost. ADFs neither prevent individuals from taking the drugs in higher doses than prescribed (which is the most common form of opioid abuse), change the addictive properties of the drug, nor prevent the other adverse, multisystem effects of opioids.</p>
        <p> Throughout the early nineteenth century, the recreational use of opium grew and by 1830, the British dependence on the drug reached an all-time high. The British sent warships to the coast of China in 1839 in response to China’s attempt to suppress the opium traffic, beginning the “First Opium War.”In 1874, chemists trying to find a less addictive form of morphine made heroin. But heroin had twice the potency of morphine, and heroin addiction soon became a serious problem.A bottle of codeine tablets—all opiates temporarily relieve pain but are highly addictive.A bottle of codeine tablets—all opiates temporarily relieve pain but are highly addictive.The US Congress banned opium in 1905 and the next year passed the Pure Food and Drug Act requiring contents labeling on all medicines.Methadone was first synthesized in 1937 by German scientists Max Bockmühl and Gustav Ehrhart at the IG Farben company. They were searching for a painkiller that would be easier to use during surgery, with less addiction potential than morphine or heroin.</p>
        <p>Yet methadone is believed by many to be even more addictive than heroin.Meanwhile, the illegal opium trade boomed. By 1995, Southeast Asia was producing 2,500 tons annually.New painkillers came on the market with approval from the Food and Drug Administration: Vicodin in 1984, OxyContin in 1995 and Percocet in 1999.These are all synthetic (man-made) opiates which mimic (imitate) the body’s own painkillers.</p>
